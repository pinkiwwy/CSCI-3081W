1. I have changed sensor_touch.h and sensor_touch.cc. I have extracted method from the accept().
   The new method is called setContact().

2. Changes are made in line 68 in the sensor_touch.h. The setContact() is declared.
   The code fragment was taken from line 35. The point_of_contact_ and angle_of_contact_ getters
   and setters are being extracted to the setContact() in line 42.

3. Turn code fragment into new extract method whose name explains the purpose of the method. This could
   make reader easier to understand the code.
